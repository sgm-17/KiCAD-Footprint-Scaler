# KiCAD-Footprint-Scaler
 Simple script to scale KiCAD graphics footprints. Useful to scale logos on the fly.
 Just export the footprint from KiCAD, input it when prompted by the terminal and choose the scale factor.

 If the name of the footprint has a scale in milimeters (ex: 5.0mm) the script will update the scale in the name of the output file.

 .exe is provided for ease of use. You can also run it from the script.

 Made with Claude and ChatGPT.
